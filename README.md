# RPG_Game_OpenGL
Using OpenGl I created an open world game.

-Implemented Grnester waves and other functions to make the waves realistic.

-Ground collision using mathematics to check the triangle that the player is in and the heigth of the poistion.

-Collision checking with elements in the scene(Trees,Leaves) using AABB and Sphere

-Cave detection so the player doesn't glitch

-Animation for the sword and shield

-Jump and gravity for the player

-World Light and Textures

-Day/night cycle

-Music

Using Dear Imgui implemented a window to display information about the world,like triangles drawn,FPS,window size...
